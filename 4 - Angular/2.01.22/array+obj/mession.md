1. create objects which describe your family (an object for each family member).
2. add the objects to an array called family (array which contains objects)
3. loop through the array, and print the name of each member.
4. add to each object of members in your family, the list of his friends (array under the object)
5. with a loop, print again the names of the family members, and all their friends. (for instance, "Mosh, had the following friends: David, Boaz, and Ruth")
6. set the previous parts into a function, so later, you can enter more families.
